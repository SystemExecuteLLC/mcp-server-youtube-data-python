# Cross-Channel YouTube Analytics Comparison Strategy

## High-Accuracy Comparison Strategy (90%+ Confidence)

### Time Period Selection
- Focus on the most recent 60 days of data
- Include complete weekly cycles to account for day-of-week variation
- Prioritize completeness over length (better to analyze 8 complete weeks than 16 partial weeks)

### Channel Selection Criteria (Refined)
- Select a direct competitor in the political comedy/news satire space 
- Must have similar content structure (mix of clips, segments, full episodes)
- Ideally connected to a TV show with similar distribution model
- Example: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver would be excellent comparison

### Data Collection Approach
1. **Stratified Sampling by Content Type:**
   - Full episodes (typically 30-60 minutes)
   - Segments (typically 8-15 minutes)
   - Clips (typically <2 minutes)
   - Collect equal numbers of each content type

2. **Match Recent Trending Topics:**
   - Pair videos covering the same news topics/events
   - This controls for topic popularity variability
   - Example: Both channels' videos about recent Trump/China trade tensions

3. **Account for Publishing Cadence:**
   - Map the publishing schedule of both channels
   - Compare equivalent days (e.g., Monday uploads to Monday uploads)
   - Account for release time differences

### Metrics to Prioritize
1. **Normalized Performance Metrics:**
   - Views per subscriber (controls for audience size differences)
   - Views per day since publication (controls for recency bias)
   - Views per minute of content (controls for length differences)
   - Engagement rate (likes + comments divided by views)

2. **Audience Behavior Metrics:**
   - Average watch percentage (if available via API)
   - Comment sentiment analysis
   - Share rate estimations

3. **Growth Indicators:**
   - 48-hour view acceleration (0-24hrs vs 24-48hrs)
   - 7-day retention curves
   - Subscriber gain per video (if trackable)

### Analysis Framework
1. **Create Equivalent Comparison Groups:**
   - 5-10 videos per content type category from each channel
   - Ensure topic matching where possible

2. **Statistical Approach:**
   - Paired analysis for topic-matched videos
   - Bootstrapping for confidence intervals
   - Effect size calculation for meaningful differences

3. **Visualization Methods:**
   - Ratio plots rather than absolute comparisons
   - Performance matrices (quadrant analysis)
   - Violin plots for distribution visualization

### Implementation Considerations
- Use YouTube API efficiently by batching requests
- Cache data to avoid duplicate requests
- Implement rate limiting to stay within quotas
- Document all API calls for reproducibility

This focused approach would produce highly reliable insights about relative channel performance in the recent period. By being selective about what we measure and how we compare it, we can achieve much higher confidence in our conclusions than trying to stretch limited data into a historical analysis.
