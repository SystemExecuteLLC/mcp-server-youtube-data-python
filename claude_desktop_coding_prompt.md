choose a function that hasn't been implemented, but is high impact from the YT Data API. Use diffs to save on token exchange instead of reading the whole files.

Also create a placeholder file in the same directory so that if I have to type 'continue', you don't start over again. Make sure not to over-engineer the solution and stick proven and tested patterns both in the codebase and in your training data.

I want you to think in terms of what functions can be added that will yield the most impact when combined together with existing functions, or grouped together if they do not yet exist. 

This should focus on adding value for creators first, since viewers are not the target of this right now.
