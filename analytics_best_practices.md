# Data Analytics Best Practices

When performing data analysis and creating visualizations, follow these essential practices:

1. **Only compare equivalent data types**—match content category, format length, and channel type for meaningful insights
2. **Use proper time normalization**—account for content age and ensure timeframes are comparable
3. **Apply appropriate context**—consider channel size, subscriber counts, and typical performance benchmarks
4. **Document your methodology**—clearly state selection criteria, data processing steps, and limitations
5. **Validate calculations**—double-check all metrics and ensure text analysis matches visualization data
6. **Use industry standard metrics**—focus on meaningful KPIs like retention rate, not just raw views
7. **Apply appropriate scaling techniques**—if scaling for visualization, maintain data integrity and clearly label accordingly
8. **Question outliers**—investigate extreme values before drawing conclusions
9. **Provide appropriate benchmarks**—use channel averages, industry standards, or historical performance
10. **Maintain visual integrity**—ensure charts accurately represent data without distortion

Analysis should enable reliable, actionable insights rather than superficial observations.
